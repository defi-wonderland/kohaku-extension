/**
 * The verify of a pasted reply against the request of its own place, judged
 * by the credential's own method module through its `verify` view, the static
 * call the manager makes at submission, so a reply reads as verified before
 * any gas is spent.
 *
 * A reply or a request without the record's shape, a reply whose place, method
 * or config differ from the request's, or whose digest is not the request's,
 * answers `rejected` with no read. The module's magic value is `satisfied`;
 * any other word, or a revert of the call, is `rejected`, since the module
 * refuses the proof. A read the provider could not make rejects, so the
 * caller reads a failed check and tries again. One read per verify; nothing
 * is cached.
