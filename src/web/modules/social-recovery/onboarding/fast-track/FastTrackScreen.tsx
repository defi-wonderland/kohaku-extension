/**
 * The fast track's route. A holder who arrives from the warning carries its
 * acknowledgment and sees step 2 of 3, the extension password, at once. Any
 * other arrival (a direct URL, a reload) meets the warning first, in the
 * recover door's form, and continue there brings the holder back here with
 * the acknowledgment.
 *
 * A device that already holds an extension password skips the step straight
 * to the key; the count does not change. Otherwise the step stores the
 * password through the wallet's own keystore setup, unlocked, and moves on
 * once the keystore holds it and is unlocked.
