 * sending key's balance, prices the assumed gas with the usual headroom, and
 * answers `enough` where the balance covers it, otherwise the fast track's
 * deposit step: the deposit from outside into the sending key, with no
 * transfer from an account, since the account cannot pay before it is
 * recovered. A read that could not run rejects with its own failure.
