 *
 * The session is read before anything is prepared, so a retry, a reload or a
 * second tab never sends a second submission for the same request: a claim
 * the session carries is followed, never sent again, and a page sends only
 * under the claim it wrote itself, with nothing awaited between the claim and
 * the hand-over to the wallet. The claim is released where the run ended with
 * nothing on its way to the chain (a send the wallet refused, a replaced
 * transaction, a revert). A send that may still land keeps it. The session
 * lands, and the screen reads landed, only after the attempt read agrees with
 * the request of this run. Every answer carries its run, so the answer of a
 * run the holder left behind moves nothing.
