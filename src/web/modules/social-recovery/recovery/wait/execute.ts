/**
 * The execution's run: the shared write machine for the gas check, the
 * deposit step, the send and the receipt, and the claim of the execution on
 * the countdown's record.
 *
 *   idle ──start──▶ checkingGas: the countdown read, the prepare, the gas check
 *                     (and where it reads enough, the block the claim starts from)
 *                     ├─ a claim on the countdown ─▶ followed (nothing sent)
 *                     ├─ deposit ──▶ needsDeposit ──the balance read again──▶ the claim
 *                     └─ enough ───▶ the claim
 *                                     ├─ another page's claim ─▶ followed (nothing sent)
 *                                     └─ its own ──▶ submitting ──▶ failedNotSent | failedReverted | landed
 *   followed, a hash ──▶ its receipt, as after a send
 *   followed, no hash ──▶ the countdown read again until a hash arrives, the
 *                         claim goes, or the claim grows older than the
 *                         plan's claim age (thirty minutes for a key's own
 *                         send, ten for the account's batch): the manager's events from
 *                         the claim's block then name the attempt consumed
 *                         (the poll goes on to the done screen) or not (the
 *                         claim released, execute offered again)
 *
 * The countdown is read before anything is prepared, so a retry, a reload or
 * a second tab never sends a second execution for the same attempt: a claim
 * the countdown carries is followed, never sent again, and a page sends only
 * under the claim it wrote itself, with nothing awaited between the claim and
 * the hand-over to the wallet. The claim is released where the run ended with
 * nothing on its way to the chain (a send the wallet refused, a replaced
 * transaction, a revert, a send no node knows at two readings apart past the
 * dropped age). A send that may still land, and a landed one, keep it until
 * the countdown ends.
 *
 * The store is kept per chain, account and attempt while work is in flight,
 * so a second press or a remount takes up the run instead of starting one. A
 * landed receipt is not the screen's done: the wait's poll reads the attempt
 * consumed before the done screen renders. Every answer carries its run, so
 * the answer of a run left behind moves nothing.
