/**
 * The execution's steps over the wallet's own seams, in the submission's
 * shape: the countdown and its execution in flight in the records, the
 * execution call the client prepares for the attempt and the payload that
 * started it, the shared gas check on the same sending key, the send through
 * the request queue by route, the receipt wait, the manager's events for a
 * claim with no hash, and the node's read of a hash.
 *
 * The run keeps its own countdown: the one that names the attempt the run
 * was started for, by its id, its setup number and its payload hash. Every
 * read of the countdown is matched on those three values, and a record of
 * another attempt, or one with none of them, reads as `replaced`. Every update
 * reads the countdown first, matches it the same way and passes the revision
 * it read; a record of another attempt is refused, with nothing claimed,
 * written or released on it. Where another page moved the run's own countdown
 * meanwhile, the update is tried again over a fresh read while the countdown
 * is there; a refused record is never tried again.
